## Project Overview
In this project, I applied my Python skills to manipulate and analyze a dataset containing medical information. The project involved cleaning, organizing, and extracting valuable insights from raw data.

## Objectives Achieved
- Loaded and Formatted Data: Imported raw medical data stored as a single string in Python, and formatted it for easier processing.
- Data Cleaning: Removed extraneous characters and spaces, and standardized the data format.
- Data Organization: Split the data into individual records and further separated each record into components such as name, age, BMI, and insurance cost.
- Data Storage: Stored the cleaned and organized data into separate lists for names, ages, BMIs, and insurance costs.
- Data Analysis:
-   Counted the total number of medical records.
-   Converted all names to uppercase for standardization.
-   Calculated the average BMI across all individuals.
-   Printed the list of names, ages, BMIs, and insurance costs.
